## code navigation
###### Key functions:
- date input should be in the format yyyy-mm-dd (2020-12-01) otherwise it will prompt the user to re-enter with a format that includes the hyphen
- saving changes is only activated if a holiday was added, otherwise it is understood that with no changes, nothing needs to be saved
